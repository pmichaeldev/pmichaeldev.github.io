                    Hello! My name is Philip. Thank you for checking out my GitHub.io page! 
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I am currently holding a Bachelor of Computer Science degree from <a href="http://www.concordia.ca/" target="_blank">Concordia University</a> in Montreal, Canada.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                    I have also completed a DEP in Computer Science Technology at <a href="http://www.vaniercollege.qc.ca/" target="_blank">Vanier College</a> as well!
                        <br />
                        <br />
                    I also am an AWS Certified Developer - Associate, and you can see my certificate <a href="https://www.credly.com/badges/1243daa6-de25-4cb3-877d-c919df2e9249" target="_blank">here!</a>
                        <br />
                        <br />
                    My expertise shines within the Micro-Services realm, especially doing cloud-native development (AWS and Azure) while leveraging C# .NET and Java. I am also actively improving my front-end experience to become a highly proficient full-stack developer.
                        <br />
